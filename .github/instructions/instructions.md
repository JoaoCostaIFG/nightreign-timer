## Application Goal
The Nightreign Timer App is designed to help players of Elden Ring: Nightreign track night phases and boss encounter timers during gameplay. The app guides users through two nights, each containing two “circle” phases (Circle One and Circle Two). Each circle phase is subdivided into a "Free Farm" and a "Circle Closing" timer, which are critical for player coordination and optimal strategy.

Keeps the mobile device’s screen awake during use for convenience.

Intended for use on a second monitor or mobile device during gameplay.

## UI Style
Visual style inspired by From Software’s Elden Ring/Nightreign aesthetics:

Rich dark purple background (#151136)

Elegant, readable white card with subtle shadows for main content

Large, visually prominent gothic-style header/banner image

Minimal, modern design with clear labels and timers

Responsive layout for both mobile and desktop

Touch-friendly buttons and controls

The primary timer card presents:

Header image: “Nightreign Timer” in gold, gothic font

Moon image: Central decorative/immersive art

Current Night: Shows if you are in First or Second Night

Total Night Timer: Counts down from 14 minutes

Current Circle and Phase: Clearly labeled (e.g. “Circle One – Free Farm”)
